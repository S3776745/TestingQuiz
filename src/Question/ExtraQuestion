This is the extra question, it's about mysql database.

I created a Mysql database on AWS and turn on the public access.

Endpoint: testdb1.cdkhpsg3t9hs.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com

port: 3306

Username: root

Password: Aa12345!

Connect to the database.
(If shows "unknown error", try to use VPN)

Create a table
name: your student id
variable: id int, name varchar, dateOfBirth date.

And insert one line, could be your info or random info.
